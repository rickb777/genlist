# GenList

This package is a typewriter for use with [gen](https://github.com/clipperhouse/gen), a type-driven code generation tool for Go.

This Go code generator offers scala-like **List** and **Option** containers, with methods such as filtering and sorting,
for working with Go types and slices of types.
